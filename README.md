# Belly Button Biodiversity Using Plotly

Plotly in JavaScript

## Overview

This project is intended to help Rosa, a biological researcher hoping to find the next bacteria that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. In order to do this she has collected samples from a number of participants' belly buttons and created a dataset of their demographic information and belly button bacteria composition. It is now time to visualize the data in a webpage that will show various charts of the participants's data.

## Objectives

-Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
-Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
-Parse data in JSON format.
-Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
-Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
-Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
-How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
-Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

## Resources

- Data file: samples.json
- Software: Plotly

## Deliverable One

Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, a horizontal bar chart was created displaying the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart displays the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart. See [an image of the chart](https://github.com/josephrodini/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Images/bbbarchart.PNG).

## Deliverable Two

Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, a bubble chart was created that displays the top 10 bacteria species by ID and size. See [an image of the chart](https://github.com/josephrodini/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Images/bbbubblechart.PNG).

## Deliverable Three

Using knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, a gauge chart was created displaying the weekly washing frequency's value and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu. See [an image of the chart](https://github.com/josephrodini/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Images/bbgaugechart.PNG).

## Deliverable Four

Using HTML and Bootstrap, the webpage for the project was customized in three ways:
- An image was added to the jumbotron.
- A background color was added.
- More information about the project was added as a paragraph on the page.
See [a screenshot of the page as a whole](https://github.com/josephrodini/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Images/bbsitewhole.PNG).

## Summary

The project was a success, and the website is live with visualization of all the participants' data. Rosa has a good lead on her hypothesis that the ideal bacterial species to launch the next artificial beef exists in the human navel.
